The name of the GridFS bucket.  Defaults to 'fs'.

A L<MongoDB::WriteConcern> object.  It may be initialized with a hash
reference that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::WriteConcern object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.

A L<MongoDB::ReadPreference> object.  It may be initialized with a string

that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::ReadPreference object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::Database> object.
